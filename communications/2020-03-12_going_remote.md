## Temporary Move to Remote Gatherings



Lovely Ruby Tuesday people,

We love seeing you all in person and would prefer to do so, however in light of COVID-19 we're doing our part to #FlattenTheCurve https://www.flattenthecurve.com/ by temporarily relocating our in-person gatherings to a remote video call from now through June 1st. Though going remote is not our favorite way to connect, we feel we can still provide that safe space to collaborate on tech problems and feel a sense of community and support, without putting the larger community at risk.

Please join us on for Ruby Tuesday 3/17/20 at 6:30pm on Zoom:

Link TBD
