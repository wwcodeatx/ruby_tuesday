MALE ALLIES:
Women Who Code events are intended to inspire women, trans, and non-binary people to excel in technology careers. We ask male allies to consider the impact of their presence on attendees. Men are welcome as guests of attending members -- please ask a friend to RSVP +1 Male for you. For volunteer opportunities, larger events like WWC Tech Talks and Hackathons can always use extra hands and help. Please reach out to those organizers on meetup.

All attendees are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct. We work hard to maintain an enjoyable, safe, harassment-free space for all attendees.
