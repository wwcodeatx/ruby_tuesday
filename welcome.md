## Code of Conduct
### Male Allies
Women Who Code events are intended to inspire women, trans, and non-binary people to excel in technology careers. We ask male allies to consider the impact of their presence on attendees. For volunteer opportunities, larger events like WWC Tech Talks and Hackathons can always use extra hands and help. Please reach out to those organizers on meetup.

All attendees are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct. We work hard to maintain an enjoyable, safe, harrassment-free space for all attendees.

### TL;DR
Women Who Code is a non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Be a good citizen! If you have experienced harassment, let one of your organizers know.
