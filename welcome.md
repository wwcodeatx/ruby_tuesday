## Code of Conduct
### Male Allies
Women Who Code events are intended to inspire women, trans, and non-binary people to excel in technology careers. We ask male allies to consider the impact of their presence on attendees. For volunteer opportunities, larger events like WWC Tech Talks and Hackathons can always use extra hands and help. Please reach out to those organizers on meetup.

All attendees are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct. We work hard to maintain an enjoyable, safe, harrassment-free space for all attendees.

### TL;DR
WWCode is a non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. We are committed to our mission statement and equally committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, socioeconomic status, caste or creed. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled permanently, at the discretion of the event organizers, which in most cases are members of the WWCode leadership team.
